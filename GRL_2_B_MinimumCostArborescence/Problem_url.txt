Minimum-Cost Arborescence(MST of Directed Graph):
For a given weighted directed graph G = (V, E),
calculate the sum of the weights of edges of the Minimum-Cost Arborescence with the root r.


ZhuLiu Algorithm: ※the information of graph is saved by edges information(start,to,weight).
1)For each vertex which is not root, find the minimum indegree except self cycle.
2)Judge the graph whether it has any unreachable vertex except root.
  ※if the graph has an unreachable vertex, it has no MST and finish here. otherwise go to next step.
3)Judge the graph whether it has cycle(s).
  ※if the graph has not any cycle, print the answer of MST and finish here. otherwise go to next step.
4)For each vertex in cycle, set the same new Id to it.
5)For the rest vertices, set different new Id to them.
6)Reset the edges information(new weight:if necessary and new endpoints Id:must) of the graph.
7)Reset the number of vertices and Id of root.
