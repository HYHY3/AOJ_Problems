Intersection Of Segment:
For given two segments s1 and s2, judge that whether they are intersect or not.
s1 is formed by end points p0 and p1, and s2 is formed by end points p2 and p3.

Algorithm Of Intersection Of Segment:
  if s1 and s2 are parallel
      if s1 and s2 are not on a line (but parallel)
          print(not intersection)
      // s1 and s2 are parallel but on a line.
      if s1 and s2 have the common space
          print(intersection)
      else
          print(not intersection)
  // s1 and s2 are not parallel
  if p2 and p3 belong to different side of s1 respectively, and p0 and p1 belong to different side of s2 respectively.
      print(intersection)
  else
      print(not intersection)

※judgment of parallel or not: cross product of two vectors.(p0→p1 and p2→p3)
※judgment of on a line or not: 
  1)sort two end points of s1 as p0 to p1.(p0 <= p1)
  2)sort two end points of s2 as p2 to p3.(p2 <= p3)
  3)calculate cross product of two vectors.(p1→p2 and p1→p3)
    ※if cross product is 0, they are on a line, otherwise not on a line.
※judgment of two points are on the different side of segment(line) or not: 
  1)calculate cross product of two vectors.(p0→p1 and p0→p2)
  2)calculate cross product of two vectors.(p0→p1 and p0→p3)
  3)if the result of step1) * the result of step2) > 0, they are on the same side of segment(line).
