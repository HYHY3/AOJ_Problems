Minimum Cost Max Flow:
Find the minimum cost to send a certain amount of flow(or max flow) through a flow network.
The flow network is a directed graph where each edge e has capacity c(e) and cost d(e).
Each edge e can send an amount of flow f(e) where f(e) <= c(e).
Find the minimum value of ∑e(f(e)×d(e)) to send an amount of flow F(or max flow) from source s to sink t.

Algorithm Of MCMF(Edmonds-Karp(based on Ford-Fulkerson) + SPFA(based on Bellman-Ford)):
1)Find an Augmenting Path which is from s to t by SPFA(Single Source Shortest Path with Negative Edges).
2)Find the minimum flow(edge) which belongs to the Augmenting Path found in step 1).
3)calculate the cost of this Augmenting Path and return to step 1), until the Augmenting Path can not be found.
