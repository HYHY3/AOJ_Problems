Distance Of Segment:
For given two segments s1 and s2, calculate the distance between them.
s1 is formed by end points p0 and p1, and s2 is formed by end points p2 and p3.

Algorithm Of Distance Of Segment:
  sort end points of segments respectively as p0 <= p1, p2 <= p3
  if s1 and s2 are intersection
      print(0)
  if s1 and s2 are not intersection
      if s1 and s2 are on the line
          print( min(distance of p1 to p2, distance of p0 to p3) )
      if s1 and s2 are not on the line
          print( distance of point to segment )

※judgment of segment intersection refers to problem CGL_2_B.
※distance of point(p) to segment(end point a to end point b):
  if p is on the left of a
      distance = p to a
  if p is on the right of b
      distance = p to b
  if p is between a and b
      distance = the orthogonal line from p to segment ※use cross product
