Bipartite Matching:
A Bipartite Graph G=(V,E) is a graph in which the vertex set V can be divided into two disjoint subsets X and Y,
such that every edge eÅ∏E has one end point in X and the other end point in Y.

Judgement of Bipartite Graph:Å¶use BFS only once to do next steps.
1)Select a random vertex as starting vertex v0.
2)Find all adjacency vertices started from v0(v1,v2,...,vn-1) and set the all adjacency vertices as v1(v2,v3,...,vn).
Å¶v0Å®v1, v1Å®v2, v2Å®v3, ..., vn-2Å®vn-1, vn-1Å®vn.
3)Return to step 2), until all vertices of the graph are visited.
4)Make the even number vertices as set X(v0,v2,v4,...,v2i), and the odd number vertices as set Y(v1,v3,v5,...,v2i+1).
5)For each edge of the graph, if the end points of the edge belong to set X and set Y respectively, the graph is Bipartite Graph.
  Otherwise, is not Bipartite Graph.


Maximal Matching Problem:
A matching M is a subset of edges such that each node in V appears in at most one edge in M.

Algorithm Of Maximal Matching Problem(Hungarian Algorithm):
1)Find an Augmenting Path.
2)Return to step 1), until the Augmenting Path can not be found.
Å¶Augmenting Path:
1)a path P of the graph started from set X(Y) and ended on set Y(X).
2)the starting vertex and the ending vertex are not be visited.
3)the order of each edge belonged to path P is that not matched(first) Å® matched Å® ... Å® not matched(last) mutually.
Å¶the format of path P looks like:
starting vertex Å® 
not matched edge(first) Å® matched edge Å® ... Å® not matched edge Å® matched edge Å® not matched edge(last) Å®
ending vertex.
