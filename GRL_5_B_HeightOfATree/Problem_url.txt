Height of a Tree:
Given a tree T with non-negative weight, find the height of each node of the tree.
For each node, the height is the distance to the most distant leaf node from the node.

For a given undirected tree with non-negative weight,
1)Find the diameter of this tree.(node u1 and u2 are the end point of the diameter respectively)
2)For the rest of each node u(except u1,u2), the height is the longer distance between distance(u,u1) and distance(u,u2).
※The Diameter of A Tree is the maximum distance between two nodes in a tree.

※Algorithm Of The Diameter of A Tree:
1)make a random node as starting node(u1), find the furthest node(u2) from this starting node(u1).
2)make node u2 as starting node(u2), find the furthest node(u3) from this starting node(u2).
3)distance between u2 and u3 is the The Diameter of this Tree.
