Range Query on a Tree:
For a given weighted rooted tree T with the following operations:
1)add(v,w):
  GRL_5_D: add w to the weight of edge which connects node v and its parent only.
  GRL_5_E: add w to the weight of all edges from the root to node v.
2)getSum(u):
  GRL_5_D(E): get the sum of weights of all edges from the root to node u.

Algorithm Of Range Query on a Tree:â€»Segment Tree
1)Use dfs algorithm to set each node as number 0(root),1,2,...,n-1,n from root.
2)Create a Complete Binary Tree(Segment Tree) to achieve the operations.
