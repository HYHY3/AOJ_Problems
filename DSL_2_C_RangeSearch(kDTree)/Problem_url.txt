For n points on a plane, find a set of points which are within in a given range.
※use kd Tree to solve this problem.

kd Tree Description ※(it looks like a k-dimensional(k>=2) Binary Search Tree)
The k-d tree is a binary tree in which every leaf node is a k-dimensional point.
Every non-leaf node can be thought of as implicitly generating a splitting hyperplane that
divides the space into two parts, known as half-spaces.
Points to the left of this hyperplane are represented by the left subtree of that node.
Points to the right of the hyperplane are represented by the right subtree.
