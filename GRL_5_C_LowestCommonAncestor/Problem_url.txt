Lowest Common Ancestor(LCA):
For a rooted tree, find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes u and v.

Algorithm Of LCA(Tarjan Algorithm):
1)Use adjacency list to save tree information and query information respectively.
2)Use dfs algorithm to get parent node information of each node.
3)For one node u which is in the query, judge the another node v was visited or not be.
  if the another node v was visited, the answer of this query is the lowest ancestor of node v(Union-Find),
  otherwise, do nothing.
