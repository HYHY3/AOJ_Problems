Topological Sort:
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) can be used to represent the ordering of tasks.
Tasks are represented by vertices and constraints where one task can begin before another, are represented by edges

For a given DAG,
1)For each vertex u of the graph, calculate its indegree and push it into queue, if its indegree is 0.
2)Pop(Print) the vertex which is in the queue, and delete the edges which are related to the vertex.
3)calculate the indegree of vertices which are related to vertex deleted in step 2). if its indegree is 0, push it into queue.
4)return to step 2) until queue is empty.
